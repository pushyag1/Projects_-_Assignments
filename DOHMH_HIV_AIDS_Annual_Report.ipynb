    "I choose this data as I was concerned about the effects of HIV increasing on an everyday basis, with a rapid deterioration of health of those affected by it. Statistics show that more people die of HIV than either of alchohol or drug overdose.\n",

    "\n",
    "Hypothesis:\n",
    "-----------\n",
    "**Hypothesis:1** There has been a decline in the number of HIV related deaths from 2011 to 2015 because of a four-part strategy began in New York post 2012 called Ending the Epidemic (EtE) , result of which is the aforementioned point.The Non-HIV related death-rate was constant but HIV-realted deaths declined thus resulting in a reduction in the overall death rates.\n",
    "     \n",
    "**Hypothesis:2** Bronx and brookyln are the two boroughs in New York city as these two boroughs have less awareness about the disease and they are populated mostly with the non-awareness communities and unrecorded death cases which is why these two boroughs have more HIV related death rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis:3** One in every seven African-American with HIV are unaware they have it. They are the most affected race among the all the races in New York city. Some African-American communities have higher rates of a few sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) than alternative racial/ethnic communities.\n",

    "**Primary Observation:** HIV related death rates are because of the people with less awareness about the disease and they are decreasing gradually from the year 2011.\n",

    "By observing the plot we can say that Latin/Hispanic Race communities are more prone towards HIV death Rates for about 1924.8 as the over all HIV-death rate and the Non-HIV related deaths are almost the same for Asian/Pacific Islander,Black,Latino/Hispanic, white which are of death rates which are 1952.9, 2652.5, 2944.8, 2850.5 respectively except for other/unknown(which aren't revealed) which was 762.9 , so Latin/Hispanic Race communities with HIV-death rates as 1924.8 are slightly more prone towards HIV than Blacks with HIV-death rates as 1812.4 and also other communities of races. There is a slight difference between blacks and Latin/Hispanic Race communities.\n",
